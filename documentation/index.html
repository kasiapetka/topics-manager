                <p>System for handling projects topics. Application is a REST API created with Spring Boot Framework,
                    React
                    Library and with PostgreSQL database. It helps in organizing project groups and sections and
                    managing them.
                    Users appear in three different roles, there is one administrator who can add various teachers.
                    Students can create account with special codes for authentication. Specific requirements and
                    features are
                    shown on multiple diagrams and charts below. Please feel encouraged to get acquainted with the
                    application
                    and its documentation as it may serve You as an instruction for using it.</p>

                <h4>Workflow</h4>
                <p>We are trying to use Agile Developement. We are making a lot of meetings where we discuss what is
                    the best for our project. We are trying to follow our Gantt Chart and sometimes we have to make
                    decisions to leave some ideas behind in order to get most important functionality working.</p>

                <p>Unfortanently this software isn't made in TDD technique, however we're trying to follow desing
                    patterns
                    and create clean code which is sometimes not that simple. After implementing bigger part of
                    functionality
                    we are reading our code and trying to make it cleaner. We are removing code duplication, splitting
                    some functions
                    into shorter ones or renaming functions, variables, classes etc to follow naming conventions.</p>
                <div id="stage1">
                    <h5>Stage One</h5>
                    <p>In stage one we were discussing how this project will work. We have specified project
                        requirements
                        and then we have splitted work between all team members. With these informations we were able to
                        create gantt's diagram. After that we also created use case diagram for our project</p>

                    <p>In second week of phase one we have set up project's structure and github repository. After that
                        we have started thinking how or model should look like. We were consulting our ideas with people
                        with greter expierience and after getting satisfying result we implemented it into our project
                        with
                        usage of JPA. With that done we created first class diagram</p>

                    <p>The last part of stage one was creating simple logic for registration and login. We decided that
                        we
                        want to use JWT for that purpose. Unfortanently JWT was completely new and it took us a lot more
                        time
                        that we thought so. So in this stage we have set up login and registration form and some
                        requests
                        for database but we didn't make that in time as our gantt's chart suggests.</p>
                </div>
                <hr>

                <div id="stage2">
                    <h5>Stage Two</h5>
                    <p>We have began stage two from setting up bigger meeting and discussing what we should do next.
                        Due to our long learning process finishing registration and login for every user took us some
                        time.</p>

                    <p>In week two of second stage we have began implementing full account modification for every type
                        of
                        user. We have started writing first Services, more controllers and our project started to look
                        like
                        MVC pattern. We have skipped implementing code authentication for student's registration because
                        we
                        decided that this is not crucial for this app to work and we have continued to implement account
                        modification.</p>

                    <p>At this moment we have started to notice that we are not following gantt's chart because our
                        assumptions
                        weren't correct. Nevertheless in the end of stage two we have spent a lot of time refactoring
                        our code
                        and we created second class diagram.</p>
                </div>
                <hr>

                <div id="stage3">
                    <h5>Stage Three</h5>
                    <p>In stage three we were focused on admin's and teacher's options. Most of our time we were
                        working on editing teacher's accounts by admin, adding them or removing them. When we had that
                        done
                        we have started to add more admin functions like creating subjects editing them or removing.</p>

                    <p>We realised that we are implementing things too slow. We were at the end of stage
                        three but we haven't even finished stage two. The reason behind that was that we were more
                        focused
                        on creating clean code and trying to implement good solutions by sometimes talking for hours
                        about
                        one not that important thing instead of making app work.</p>
                </div>
                <hr>

                <div id="stage4">
                    <h5>Stage Four</h5>
                    <p>In stage four in first week we have implemented codes authentication when student tries to
                        register,
                        full modification of subject and adding teachers to it by admin. Also we have finished
                        implementing topics
                        and its functionality. We have created management system for sections by admin and teacher and
                        we
                        linked these three components (subject, topic, section) togheter.
                    </p>

                    <p>In second week of phase four we refactored our gantt's chart because we were falling apart. We
                        managed
                        to finish basic implementation of issuing grades. We have made a lot of refactoring on
                        front-side for better
                        code transparency. We have also speed up with work due to our delay.</p>

                <p>Service Layer specifies interfaces with functions which are neccesary for application to work. Then

                <h4>Authentication and Authorization</h4>
                <p>Authentication and authorization is achieved with using two main components: Spring Security and JWT.
                    In Topics Manager every User that is registered into system has login which is email, and password.
                    Aditionally every user has its role: Admin, Teacher or Student.</p>
                <div id="springsecurity">
                    <h5>Spring Security</h5>
                    <p>Spring Security is configured to listen for requests on /api/login endpoint. When it gets correct
                        request it is performing two queries for database. First query checks if given credentials were
                        correct
                        and second is checking which role this user has.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="jwt">
                    <h5>Authorization using Json Web Tokens: </h5>
                    <p>Authorization in Topics Manager Application is implemented using Json Web Tokens. When the user
                        wants to log in and passes correct credentials server responds with a token that holds user
                        email
                        and
                        the time of token expiration. Then whenever the user wants to retrive information from the
                        server
                        client app passes the token he recieved in a HTTP request header. This way of authentication
                        brings the application security on the highest level.</p>

                    which is assigned when user is registered. Every user is assigned to Student or Teacher object

                    is messaging system, because it could be a socket listening to new messages and we could
                    notify the user at the time he gets a new message about it. The rest is done pretty well,
                    the application is intuitive and really nice to use. We had an opportunity to learn many new
                    technologies and improve our coding skills. Summarizing we are pleased with the effect and we
                    hope we could expand this version easily in the future.
